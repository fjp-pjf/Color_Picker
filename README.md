# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a color picker app designed with React.js We can change the colors we have already assigned by clicking on them.The app is designed with stateful components and colors are made random to appear each time we click on them without repeating simultaneously.
